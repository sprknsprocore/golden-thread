# Workflow Definition: The Golden Thread

The prototype demonstrates a closed-loop data lifecycle.

---

### Phase 1: The Baseline (Setup)
* **Granular Task Mapping:** Estimating assemblies (e.g., 12" vs 30" pipe) map directly to WBS codes rather than rolled-up lump sums.
* **Production Targets:** Every line item includes two non-monetary baselines: **Budgeted Production Qty** and **Budgeted Hours**.
* **Provisional Selection:** PMs select a "to-do list" of codes for the week that **persist** in the view even with zero values.

### Phase 2: The Reality (Execution)
* **Unified Capture:** Foremen log labor hours, equipment, and units on a single, mobile-optimized grid.
* **Contextual Tagging:** Qualitative notes (e.g., "Waiting on RFI") are linked directly to quantitative production events.
* **Claiming Schemas:** Progress for complex tasks is measured via "Rules of Credit" (e.g., Excavation = 20%, Laying Pipe = 40%).

### Phase 3: The True-Up (Reconciliation)
* PMs review raw field data and apply an **Override Layer** based on site walks to inform financial forecasting without deleting the foreman's original record.

### Phase 4: The Feedback Loop
* Final production rates (e.g., 0.14 MH/LF) are pushed back to the Estimating database to refine the next bid's accuracy.
