# UI/UX Requirements: "The Minute Test"

Demonstrating that capturing granular data takes less than a minute.

## 1. Multi-Tier Code Picker
* **Description-First Hierarchy:** Descriptions are bolded and primary; numerical codes are secondary.
* **Flat Navigation:** Uses a flat list with multi-segment filters to avoid "hierarchical dead-ends".
* **Visual Delimiters:** Uses arrows (>) for clear hierarchy designation.

## 2. Integrated Grid View
* A single screen combining Labor, Equipment, and Units Installed.
* Provides real-time "Winning/Losing" feedback during data entry.

## 3. Reconciliation Layer
* A split-view for PMs to see "Field Suggested" vs "PM Validated" quantities.
* Includes **Contextual Sidebars** for quick entry of variance reasons (e.g., constraints like weather or RFIs).
