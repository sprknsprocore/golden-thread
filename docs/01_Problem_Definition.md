# Problem Definition: Scaling Veteran Intuition

## 1. The Expertise Cliff
Construction is losing veteran supervisors who can "feel" a 20% delay. Junior PMs manage risk through "gut feelings" because current systems are operationally blind.

## 2. Fragmented Reality
* **The Search/Double-Entry Tax:** Field teams enter time for payroll and quantities for progress in separate, siloed logs.
* **The Spreadsheet Crutch:** High-tier contractors (like KHS&S) rely on complex Excel monstrosities to bridge field data and ERP financial data.

## 3. The Bidding Blind Spot
Estimators build granular assemblies, but operations "dumbs down" the budget to single lump-sum codes to prevent miscoding. This destroys the historical feedback loop needed for accurate future bidding.

## 4. Interaction Friction
* **Non-Persistence:** In current tools, selected task codes disappear if no value is entered immediately, forcing repetitive weekly setup.
* **Hierarchy Dead-Ends:** Code pickers often lead users to "dead ends" with no values, causing frustration during data entry.
